# Exercise 2: Multi-Agent Collaboration and A2A Communication

## Estimated Duration: 90 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you’ll build a multi-agent system using the Microsoft Agent Framework. You’ll define distinct agent roles (Planner, HR, Compliance), deploy them, and configure A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication to allow one agent to call others. You’ll test a scenario where a user query is delegated through the agent network, and then inspect traces and logs to confirm correct routing.

The Microsoft Agent Framework SDK is the new official development kit for building intelligent, modular agents that can reason, take actions, and collaborate with other agents. It provides:

- Unified Agent Architecture – Replaces AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, and fragmented orchestrators

- Built-in Support for Azure AI Foundry – Deploy agents directly into Foundry’s Agent Service

- Tooling via MCP (Model Context Protocol) – Standardized integration with data, APIs, systems

- Native A2A Communication – Agents can call other agents as autonomous collaborators

This SDK is designed to support enterprise-grade, production-ready agent systems, with reliability, observability, and governance baked in from the start.

               "Return exactly one word: HR, FINANCE, or COMPLIANCE. "
               "Consider keywords like: money, cost, budget, reimburse, expense, payment, allowance → FINANCE\n"
               "Keywords like: leave, sick, vacation, policy, employee, benefits → HR\n"
               "Keywords like: GDPR, privacy, compliance, legal, audit, regulation → COMPLIANCE"
         ),
      )

   async def classify_target(planner_agent, user_query: str) -> str:
      result = await planner_agent.run(
         "Analyze and route this query:\n\n"
         f"User query: {user_query}\n\n"
         "Return exactly one word: HR, FINANCE, or COMPLIANCE."
      )
      # Extract the text content from the AgentRunResponse object

         finance_keywords = ["reimburs", "expense", "cost", "budget", "money", "payment", "allowance", "travel", "meal", "flight", "hotel"]
         hr_keywords = ["leave", "sick", "vacation", "employee", "benefit", "policy", "hire", "performance", "work"]
         compliance_keywords = ["gdpr", "privacy", "compliance", "legal", "audit", "regulation", "data protection"]
         
         finance_score = sum(1 for keyword in finance_keywords if keyword in query_lower)
         hr_score = sum(1 for keyword in hr_keywords if keyword in query_lower)
         compliance_score = sum(1 for keyword in compliance_keywords if keyword in query_lower)
         
         if finance_score > hr_score and finance_score > compliance_score:
               return "FINANCE"
         elif hr_score > compliance_score:
               return "HR"
         else:
               return "COMPLIANCE"
   ```

### Task 4: Define A2A Routing Logic (Agent Graph / Workflow)

Agent-to-Agent (A2A) is a core capability of the Microsoft Agent Framework that allows one agent to autonomously delegate tasks to another agent.

In this task, you will implement routing logic using an Agent Workflow so the Planner can autonomously call HR or Compliance agents based on query intent. This establishes true multi-agent collaboration.

1. From the list, select `main.py` under agent folder and add the following python code to configure A2A communiction flow agent. Add the following python code to configure agent routing logic.

   >Central Execution Engine:
   > - This script acts as the core orchestrator, coordinating all agents (Planner, HR, Finance, Compliance) and managing multi-agent routing using the Microsoft Agent Framework.

   >Agent Network Initialization:
   > - It loads environment settings, builds each agent with await build_*_agent(), and registers them into a shared dictionary for easy delegation.

   >Advanced A2A Routing:
   > - The run_multi_agent() function routes user queries to the correct specialist through the Planner, then awaits the specialist agent’s response. It captures routing, timing, success status, and final answer.

   >Multiple Execution Modes:
   > - Batch Mode: Runs predefined test queries.
   > - Interactive Mode (--interactive): Enables real-time chat for live testing and exploration.

   >Production-Ready Resilience:
   > - Includes response formatting, timestamps, error fallback mechanisms, and logging — laying a strong foundation for observability, telemetry, and AgentOps in later exercises.

### Task 5: Test Multi-Agent Conversation & Inspect Logs

In this task, you will run end-to-end test queries through the multi-agent system and observe agent collaboration using logs and telemetry in Azure AI Foundry.

1. You have successfully configured the multi agent system with a planner agent and worker agents. Now, you'll test the working of this multi-agent system.

   >**Note:** Although the multi-agent system is now configured with LLM capabilities, it does not yet have MCP integration or access to external knowledge sources such as datasets or Azure AI Search indexes. At this stage, the agents will rely solely on their general model intelligence to answer questions.

1. Select the **... (1)** option from the top menu to extend the menu. Select **Terminal (2)** and click on **New Terminal (3)**.

   ![](./media/ss-40.png)

1. Once the terminal is open, run the following command to run the agent and review the responses for the test prompts provided in the code file.

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   ![](./media/ss-41.png)

   > Check **Routed to** parameter and review how the agent is determining and routing the requests to respective worker agents.

1. Now, run the agent again on interactive mode by adding `--interactive` flag. This lets you input the question and get the response back. Provide the below prompt as question once it asks.

   > `Is employee data protected under GDPR?` 

   ```
   python main.py --interactive
   ```

   ![](./media/ss-42.png)

1. Once after getting the response, in the next prompt add `q` to quit the agent or stop the agent.

## Summary

In this exercise, you defined three agents (Planner, HR, Compliance) using the Microsoft Agent Framework SDK and registered them. You built a routing workflow to delegate user queries via Agent-to-Agent calls. You tested a multi-agent scenario and inspected logs to confirm correct message routing and execution flow.
