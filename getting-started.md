# Enterprise Agentic AI with Microsoft Agent Framework

## Overall Estimated Duration: 6 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, participants will learn to design, build, and deploy enterprise-grade AI agents using the Microsoft Agent Framework and Azure AI Foundry. Through a series of hands-on exercises, they will create a multi-agent system that can intelligently route queries across HR, Finance, and Compliance domains, retrieve contextual data from Azure AI Search, and integrate with enterprise tools like Freshdesk for ticket management.

By the end of the lab, learners will have deployed their agents to the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, gaining experience with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, multi-agent orchestration, tool calling, and runtime monitoring, building a complete, production-ready agentic AI solution aligned with Microsoft’s modern enterprise architecture.

## Objectives

- Build a **RAG** knowledge base with **Azure AI Search** and connect it to agents via an **MCP tool**.
- Author single- and multi-agent workflows with the **Microsoft Agent Framework SDK**.
- Implement **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** routing: Planner → HR/Finance/Compliance.
- Integrate an external system (**Freshdesk**) to create real tickets from agent actions.
- Deploy to **Azure AI Foundry Agent Service** and analyze **Thread Logs** & **Monitoring**.
- Apply runtime policies (timeouts, rate limits, token budgets) for safe, cost-controlled ops.

## Pre-requisites

- Basic understanding of Agentic AI concepts (agents, tools, A2A, RAG).
- Working knowledge of the Azure Portal and Azure AI Foundry.
- Familiarity with Python and Visual Studio Code (integrated terminal).
- Basic Git usage (clone, open folder) and editing `.env` files.

## Explaination of components

- **Microsoft Agent Framework SDK** — Define the Planner + HR/Finance/Compliance agents, instructions, and A2A routing.
- **Azure AI Foundry** — Create/configure agents, connect knowledge, test in Playground, and deploy via **Agent Service**; observe runs with **Thread Logs** and **Application Insights**.
- **Azure AI Search (RAG)** — Index enterprise docs and return grounded snippets that agents use for accurate answers.
- **Azure Storage (Blob)** — Holds source datasets that are ingested into Azure AI Search.
- **MCP-style Tools** — `AzureSearchTool` (queries the index for context) and `FreshdeskTool` (creates support tickets via Freshdesk).
- **Developer Stack (on VM)** — **Visual Studio Code** for editing/running Python (**3.11+**) agent code, with basic **Git** usage to manage the provided project.
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio** — No/low-code environment to design, configure, and publish copilots. Great for wiring topics, guardrails, connectors, and quick channel publishing (e.g., Teams) without deep code changes.
