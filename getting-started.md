# Enterprise Agentic AI with Microsoft Agent Framework

## Overall Estimated Duration: 6 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, participants will learn to design, build, and deploy enterprise-grade AI agents using the Microsoft Agent Framework and Azure AI Foundry. Through a series of hands-on exercises, they will create a multi-agent system that can intelligently route queries across HR, Finance, and Compliance domains, retrieve contextual data from Azure AI Search, and integrate with enterprise tools like Freshdesk for ticket management.

By the end of the lab, learners will have deployed their agents to the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, gaining experience with Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, multi-agent orchestration, tool calling, and runtime monitoring, building a complete, production-ready agentic AI solution aligned with Microsoftâ€™s modern enterprise architecture.
