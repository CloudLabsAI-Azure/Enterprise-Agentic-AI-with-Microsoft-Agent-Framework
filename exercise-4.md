# Exercise 4: Agent Deployment and Runtime Management in Azure AI Foundry

## Estimated Duration: 60 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you’ll deploy your multi-agent system (developed using the Microsoft Agent Framework SDK) into the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service.
You’ll publish the configured agent into a managed runtime environment, define operational policies, and explore diagnostic tools to monitor live sessions.

## Exercise Objectives

You'll perform the following task in this exercise

- Task 1: Deploy Agents to Azure AI Foundry Agent Service
- Task 2: Configure Agent Policies and Execution Limits
- Task 3: Monitor and Debug Live Agent Sessions

### Task 1: Deploy Agents to Azure AI Foundry Agent Service

In this task, you’ll package and publish your multi-agent system to the Azure AI Foundry portal so it can run in a secure, scalable managed environment.

### Task 2: Configure Agent Policies and Execution Limits

In this task, you’ll apply operational governance to your deployed agent by defining policies such as rate limits, execution timeouts, and token budgets.

### Task 3: Monitor and Debug Live Agent Sessions

In this task, you’ll explore how to monitor your deployed agent’s live sessions, view structured logs, and debug conversation traces directly from the portal.

## Summary

In this exercise, you successfully deployed your locally built multi-agent system into the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service.
You configured runtime governance through policies, monitored execution through structured logs, and used diagnostics to validate live agent interactions, making your solution production ready and enterprise compliant.
